        In this part of the document the various sections should be added.

        \begin{definition}[Definition] \label{definition label}

            This is a definition. If you want to see the implementation, it is found in \texttt{0/theorem.tex}.
        \end{definition}

        If you want to hide a \textit{List of ...} because you did not use some of them, you can hide it by going to \texttt{0/list\_of\_theorem}.

        \gls{acr}: this is a glossary item, it is found in \texttt{0/list\_of\_glossary.tex}, if you want to add a new type of glossary you add it in \texttt{0/glossary.tex}.

        \cref{definition label}: this is a reference to a definition. \cref{This is an algorithm}: this is a reference to an algorithm.
